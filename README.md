# MandelZoom

A Clojurescript Mandelbrot set display implementation, based on the
description of such a program by A. K. Dewdney in "The Armchair Universe."

## Installation

Download from [Github]( http://github.com/mpwillson/mandel).  You'll need
everthing under the resources directory, which you should copy to an
appropriate location (or web server) and change as required by the
environment.

## Usage
    
Hit Display to show the Mandelbrot set, using the values in the
parameter fields.  The defaults show a good overview.  You can click
and drag a zoom box in the display area.  Hit Zoom to display the
selected area.  Back will return you to the previous view.
